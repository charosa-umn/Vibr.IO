## How Can I Contribute?
At this stage of development, we intend for project code to be written by Charosa Research Incubator members.
However, we are accepting bug reports and feature requests from outside contributors. 

## Reporting a Bug
Bugs can be reported by filing a GitHub issue. 
Be sure to answer these five questions:

* What version of Vibr.IO are you using?
* What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
* What did you do?
* What did you expect to see?
* What did you see instead? 

## Suggesting a Feature
A feature can be suggested by filing a GitHub issue. 
Please organize your feature request using this template:

* Summary
* Motivation
* Describe alternatives you've considered
* Additional context

## Reviewing Contributions
Unaddressed bug reports and feature requests will be reviewed periodically by a member of Charosa Research Incubator. For any direct questions or comments, email charosa@umn.edu.
